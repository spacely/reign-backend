- **Framework**: Express.js 4.18+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions
- **Security**: Helmet middleware, CORS, input validation
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized, Railway ready

### Key API Endpoints

#### User Management
- `POST /profiles` - Create user profile
- `GET /profiles/:id` - Get user profile
- `PUT /profiles/:id` - Update user profile
- `GET /profiles/by-email/:email` - Get profile by email

#### Location Services
- `POST /locations` - Update user location
- `GET /locations/nearby` - Find nearby users

#### Social Features
- `POST /pings` - Broadcast location-based ping
- `GET /pings/nearby` - Find nearby pings (1km radius)
- `POST /connect` - Connect with another user
- `GET /connections/:userId` - Get user connections

#### Validation System
- `GET /validation/nearby` - Find users available for validation
- `POST /validation/request` - Request validation
- `POST /validation/respond` - Respond to validation request
- `GET /validation/pending/:userId` - Get pending requests

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- **users**: User accounts (email, name, timestamps)
- **profile_items**: Flexible profile data (skills, education, experience)
- **locations**: Current user locations with PostGIS indexing
- **pings**: Location-based broadcasts with mood/category
- **connections**: User social connections
- **validation_requests**: Peer validation requests
- **validation_records**: Completed validations

#### Key Features
- UUID primary keys throughout
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- PostGIS spatial indexing for location queries
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships
- Optimized indexes for performance

### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required software
Node.js 18+
PostgreSQL 13+ with PostGIS
npm 8+
Docker (optional)
```

#### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd reign-backend
npm install

# 2. Setup database
createdb reign_db
psql reign_db -f database/schema.sql

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
ALLOW_MIGRATIONS=false
```

### Deployment

#### Docker
```bash
docker build -t reign-backend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e DATABASE_URL=... reign-backend
```

#### Railway
- Push to main branch for automatic deployment
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in Railway dashboard
- Uses `/health` endpoint for monitoring

### Key Business Rules

#### Location & Proximity
- Coordinates in decimal degrees format
- Distance calculations use PostGIS earthdistance
- Nearby searches support custom radius
- Validation requires 3-meter proximity

#### Pings System
- 15-minute visibility window
- 1km discovery radius
- Categories: skill, education, experience
- Mood-based filtering

#### Validation System
- Requires existing user connection
- Physical proximity (3 meters) required
- Peer-to-peer validation model
- Request expiration handling

#### Security & Privacy
- No authentication system (delegated to client)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection
- CORS and security headers enabled
- Profile images limited to 2MB JPEG

### Performance Characteristics

#### Database Optimization
- Connection pooling configured
- Spatial indexes on latitude/longitude
- JSONB indexes for profile searches
- Efficient foreign key relationships

#### Scalability Considerations
- Stateless API design
- Connection pooling for database
- Geospatial queries optimized with PostGIS
- Docker containerization ready

### Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Health Checks
- `GET /health` - Service health endpoint
- Database connection verification
- PostGIS extension status checks

#### Key Metrics
- API response times
- Database connection pool usage
- Geographic query performance
- Active user and ping counts

#### Useful Queries
```sql
-- Service health
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pings WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';

-- Performance monitoring
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## Common Use Cases

### Mobile App Integration
1. **User Registration**: `POST /profiles` with email and profile data
2. **Location Updates**: `POST /locations` with user coordinates
3. **Discover Nearby**: `GET /locations/nearby` or `GET /pings/nearby`
4. **Social Features**: `POST /connect` and validation endpoints
5. **Profile Management**: `PUT /profiles/:id` for updates

### Real-time Features
- Location broadcasting with automatic proximity detection
- Ping system for mood/skill sharing
- Validation requests for peer verification
- Social connections with proximity requirements

### Geographic Features
- PostGIS-powered spatial queries
- Configurable search radius
- Distance calculations and filtering
- Geographic distribution analysis
